This is a bundle for TextMate that adds the D Scripting language for DTrace and several useful DTrace scripts to TextMate. See the "Wiki" section at the top of the page for a more detailed explanation as to what works and what doesn't work right now.

What's Changed in 1.0 Beta 4
[CHANGED] Cleaning up Menu Structure some menu items have moved around slightly
[NEW] Scripts in the "More Mac OS X D Scripts" menu

What's Changed in 1.0 Beta 3?
[NEW] Run Script in terminal works! This is very preliminary and works for scripts that don't have "$target" (ones where you would invoke the script with -p) eventually a mechanism will be added so you can specify a pid or select an App to trace before running
[NEW] Entry & Return DTrace keywords and Tab Triggers

[FIX] Removed Redundant ustack() calls inside the Core Data Snippets
[FIX] One of the recently added DTrace providers still had boiler text there for some reason, changed this to the provider name
[FIX] Added the scope ( source.d ) to the newly added DTrace providers that were lacking any scope
[CHANGED] Changed "D Script" to just "D", screw the other D :P

What's changed in 1.0 Beta 2?
[ADDED] List of DTrace Providers

[FIX] Target's Trigger (keyboard shortcut "\") has been removed
[FIX] "$target" instead of just "target" is recognized as a DTrace keyword
[FIX] Many snippets had "source.d," as the scope instead of just "source.d" which meant that the tab triggers extended into any TextMate Document
[FIX] Many DTrace keywords in the "More DTrace Keywords" had no scope, this has been changed to "source.d"
[CHANGED] D Script Language Keyboard Shortcut to avoid conflict with "Diff"
